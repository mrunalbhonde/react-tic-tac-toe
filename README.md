This is a tic-tac-toe game which:
- Lets you play tic-tac-toe,
- Indicates when a player has won the game,
- Stores a game’s history as a game progresses,
- Allows players to review a game’s history and go back to previous step of the game.

Future updates:
- To add a toggle button that lets you sort the moves in either ascending or descending order.
- When someone wins, highlighting the three squares that caused the win (and when no one wins, displaying a message about the result being a draw).
- Displaying the location for each move in the format (row, col) in the move history list.
